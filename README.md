## Introduction

The DMFT Project is a Python-based tool designed to automate and streamline the DMFT loop, facilitating the computation of hybridization functions and self-energy convergence. It leverages NRG-based solvers and incorporates optional mixing methods to improve convergence stability and speed. The application also features a robust logging system to aid in monitoring processes and debugging.

## Features

- **DMFT Iterations:** Automates the DMFT loop to compute and update hybridization functions (`Delta.dat`).
- **Mixing Methods:** Supports three mixing strategies to enhance convergence:
  - **None:** No mixing applied.
  - **Anderson Mixing:** Utilizes Anderson's method for mixing.
  - **Broyden Mixing:** Employs Broyden's method for mixing.
- **Logging:** Comprehensive logging system capturing all processes and mixing-specific logs.
- **Error Handling:** Robust error management ensuring graceful exits and informative logs.
- **Modular Design:** Organized into distinct modules for generation, simulation, averaging, and more.

### Module Breakdown

- **generate_delta.py:** Generates and updates the hybridization function `Delta.dat` and `Delta-re.dat`.
- **odesolv.py:** Executes ODE-based discretization for NRG.
- **simulation.py:** Runs impurity simulations with different `z`-values.
- **average.py:** Performs broadening/averaging of the output data.
- **realparts.py:** Calls the `kk` tool to compute real parts from imaginary parts.
- **sigmatrick.py:** Computes self-energy (`Sigma`) from imaginary and real Greenâ€™s functions.
- **dmft.py:** Finalizes the DMFT loop update of `Delta.dat`, calls `kk` if needed.
- **anderson.py:** Implements Anderson mixing method.
- **broyden.py:** Implements Broyden mixing method.
